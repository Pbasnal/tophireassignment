This code uses pycookiecheat package to capture the cookies from a chrome sqlite datastore. This allows the user to login once on the browser and then run the script as many times as needed.

Since, pycookiecheat works only on Linux and Mac as of now, this tool also works on Linux or Mac.

To use this, login to the https://tophire.freshteam.com/ and run python3 hire.py. It'll try to upload a dummy attachment.
